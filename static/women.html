                Fertility quotient is an indicator of an individual’s capability to reproduce. The subjective topic of fertility reserve
                is being converted to an objective score. It is ascore against 100, given against inputs provided by the user. The score is then converted to an 
                indicative value to help the person understand the status of his / her fertility levels.

                Women who get a rating of “Poor Fertility” for their fertility quotient are advised to meet a fertility
                specialist immediately. The algorithm gives this rating only if the situation is dire and only if it needs quick
                intervention. In most cases, this rating will be got if the age of the women is well past the “best fertility age range”
                and if the ovarian reserves are depleted significantly.
                <br><br>
                Important point to note here is that there are various treatment options for such women, including IVF and various donor
                programs

            <article class="exposition"> 
                A lady with a fertility quotient of “Low Fertility” has to take things seriously. There are some things
                that are not as good as they should be. It can be the age, the BMI or the ovarian reserves may be depleting or multiple
                factors may be affecting fertility. A lady with “Low Fertility” can move to “Poor Fertility” rather quickly. Such women
                should meet a fertility specialist quickly and address the problem of infertility.
                <br><br>
                One important point to note here is that some of the key factors affecting fertility cannot be rolled back. Once they
                deteriorate, they stay that way or become worse. So women with a fertility quotient of “Low Fertility” should move
                quickly, if they plan to have a child.
                <br><br>
                It is recommended that such women to meet up with a fertility specialist immediately and get some investigations done to
                understand the situation in more detail. A good fertility specialist should be able to help such women conceive with the
                various artificial reproduction techniques that are available (Timed intercourse, IUI, IVF, IVF-ICSI, IMSI etc.)

            <article class="exposition">
                A lady with Average Fertility needs to play it safe. It means that her fertility status is not too
                good, but neither is it very bad. It also indicates that it is not long before the fertility levels will drop quickly.
                Such women are advised to plan for a child immediately and if there is no conception within 6 months, they need to meet
                up with a fertility expert and take the doctor’s advice.
                <br><br>
                In-principle, women with Average Fertility should be able to conceive. In case this does not happen, it is possible that
                there are other factors that are contributing to the observed infertility. These factors could be problems with the
                fallopian tubes, there may be infections in the female reproductive canal, the oocyte quality may not be good, there may
                be male factors also influencing conception etc.
                <br><br>
                It is advised that such women to meet up with a fertility expert as soon as possible and proceed as per their advice.
                Some investigations may be needed to understand the cause behind the observed infertility.

            <article> class="exposition"
                This status indicates that the lady is at the peak of her reproductive life-span. All her indicators are positive and the time is 
                best suited for planning a child. Women who fall in this group need not worry much about their fertility status. Their internal 
                systems are primed and ready for reproduction.
                <br><br>
                If women with “Best Fertility” status are planning to delay their plans of having a child by a few years, it may be better to freeze their eggs 
                at this stage. The delay in child-bearing could be due to career reasons, personal reasons. It is recommended that such women to go 
                for oocyte freezing. The technology of oocyte freezing is improving quickly and eggs may be frozen for years. The frozen “best” 
                oocytes can be used for fertilization with the husband’s sperms at a later point of time.
                <br><br>
                If a lady has a fertility quotient of “Best Fertility” and is still unable to conceive, there may be other factors at play. It is 
                possible that there are male fertility is not optimum or there may be fallopian tube blocks or the oocyte quality has some problems 
                or there may be infections that are preventing conception or it can be even be a thyroid related issue.
                <br><br>
                Please consult a fertility specialist for further investigation for the cause of infertility.

            <article class="exposition"> 
                A lady with a fertility quotient of “good fertility” is in good shape for having a child. There are one
                or two factors that have started to deteriorate but there is nothing alarmingly wrong. The hormone levels and the
                general health condition is good and there is no significant reason to be worried. Most couples with this fertility
                quotient should be able to conceive within a span of 1 year if they are having unprotected intercourse.
                <br><br>
                If women with “Good Fertility” status are planning to delay their plans of having a child by a few years, it may be
                better to freeze their eggs at this stage. The delay in child-bearing could be due to career reasons, personal reasons.
                It is recommended that such women to go for oocyte freezing. The technology of oocyte freezing is improving quickly and

                later point of time.
                <br><br>
                One important point to note here is that a lady with a fertility quotient of “Good Fertility” can still find it
                difficult to conceive because there are various other factors that play a role. There could be problems with the
                fallopian tubes, there may be infections in the female reproductive canal, the oocyte quality may not be good, there may
                be male factors also influencing conception etc. Such women may need to consult a fertility specialist for further
                investigation for the cause of infertility.

            <article class="exposition">
                * There have many research articles that address this topic of fertility capability. All research articles are more or less unanimous in 
                their findings that a lady’s fertility is based on several factors which include  her age, her Antral Follicular Count (AFC), her AMH 
                hormone levels and her general health condition. There are also other fringe  factors that contribute to the fertility aspect – like 
                tobacco usage, addiction to alcohol or other drugs etc.
                <br><br>
                The score is calculated based on the woman’s fertility factors - AMH, AFC, Age and BMI. Some of these factors play a role more critical than the others. 
                So, proper adjustments have been done in the algorithm to manage these variations.
                <br><br>
                Please note that the fertility quotient is an indicator of the fertility status. It is not a definitive advice from the doctor. 
                Consult a fertility specialist to know more about your fertility quotient and fertility status. It is also important to note that a 
                woman may move from one stage to another rather quickly based on the parameters that play a role. For example, a lady with a fertility 
                quotient of “Best Fertility” may move to “Good Fertility” within the matter of a few months if her age is beyond 30 and if her AMH or AFC starts dropping quickly.
